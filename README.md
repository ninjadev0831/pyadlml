# Activities of Daily Living - Machine Learning
> Contains data preprocessing and visualization methods for ADL datasets.

Activities of Daily living (ADLs) e.g cooking, sleeping, and devices readings are recorded by smart homes inhabitants. The goal is to predict inhabitants activities using device readings. Pyadlml offers an easy way to fetch, visualize and preprocess common datasets. A further goal is to replicate prominent work in this domain.

## Last Stable Release
```sh 
$ pip install pyadlml
```
## Latest Development Changes
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/tcsvn/pyadlml
$ cd pyadlml
```

## Usage example
```python
from pyadlml.dataset import fetch_amsterdam

# Fetch dataset
data = fetch_amsterdam(cache=True)

# plot the persons activity density distribution over one day
from pyadlml.dataset.plot.activities import ridge_line
ridge_line(data.df_activities)

# plot the signal cross correlation between devices
from pyadlml.dataset.plot.devices import heatmap_cross_correlation
heatmap_cross_correlation(data.df_devices)

# create a raw representation with timeslices of 20 seconds
from pyadlml.preprocessing import DiscreteEncoder, LabelEncoder
enc_dat = DiscreteEncoder(rep='raw', t_res='20s')
X = enc_dat.fit_transform(data.df_devices).values

# label the datapoints with the corresponding activity
y = LabelEncoder(X).fit_transform(data.df_activities)

# do all the other fancy machine learning stuff you already know
from sklearn import SVM 
SVM().fit(X).score(X,y)
...
```
