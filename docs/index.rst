.. warning::
   As this project is still under active development, please note that the information 
   presented here is subject to change and should be approached with caution.


Activities of Daily living (ADLs) such as eating, working, sleeping and Smart Home device readings are recorded by inhabitants. 
Predicting resident activities based on the device event-stream allows for a range of applications, including automation, 
action recommendation and abnormal activity detection in the context of assisted living for elderly inhabitants. 
Pyadlml offers an easy way to fetch, visualize and preprocess common datasets.
