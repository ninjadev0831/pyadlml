Datasets
========

.. warning::
    Project is under heavy development. Dataset information is wrong or incomplete. I am
    going to update this as soon as possible.

The page displays an exhaustive list of datasets supported by pyadlml.
The attributes *activities* and *devices* follow the scheme  ``#x/#X``.
For example ``activities: 7/263`` means the dataset possesses :math:`7` activities with :math:`263`
recordings. The ``DeviceType`` informs whether the the devices are *boolean*, *numerical* or *categorical*
Make sure to also check out the `notebooks`_.

:Abstract: The dataset consists of two separate datasets generated by two subjects. You can load either
    by passing the right subject attribute into the ``fetch_mitlab`` function.

To download the dataset execute

.. code:: python

    from pyadlml.dataset import fetch_mitlab

    data_1 = fetch_mitlab(cache=True, keep_original=True, subject="subject1")
    dir(data_1)
    >>> [..., df_activities, df_devices, ...]
    data_2 = fetch_mitlab(cache=True, keep_original=True, subject="subject2")
    dir(data_2)
    >>> [..., df_activities, df_devices, ...]

:Abstract: This dataset comprises information regarding the ADLs performed by two users on a daily basis in their
    own homes. This dataset is composed by two instances of data, each one corresponding to a different
    user and summing up to 35 days of fully labelled data. Each instance of the dataset is described by
    three text files, namely: description, sensors events (features), activities of the daily living (labels).
    Sensor events were recorded using a wireless sensor network and data were labelled manually.

The dataset consists of two datasets. You can load either dataset by passing ``OrdonezA``
or ``OrdonezB`` with ``subject`` parameter to the fetch function:

.. code:: python

    from pyadlml.dataset import fetch_uci_adl_binary

    data = fetch_uci_adl_binary(subject='OrdonezA')
    dir(data)
    >>> [..., df_activities, df_devices, ...]

    data = fetch_uci_adl_binary(subject='OrdonezB')
    dir(data)
    >>> [..., df_activities, df_devices, ...]

or the `uci adl binary subjectA notebook`_.
