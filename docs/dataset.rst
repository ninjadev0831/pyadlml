Datasets
========

Here is a list of datasets supported by pyadlml. Make sure to also check out the `notebooks`_.
The field *activities* and *devices* follow the scheme  ``#nr/recorded number#``.

.. warning::
    Project is under heavy development. Dataset information is wrong or incomplete. I am
    going to update this as soon as possible.

The fetch methods. When you want to keep the dataset pass the parameter

:abstract: The dataset spans two dataset generated by two subjects. You can either by passing the right
    subject attribute into the ``fetch_mitlab`` function.

To download the dataset execute

.. code:: python

    from pyadlml.dataset import fetch_mitlab

    data_1 = fetch_mitlab(cache=True, keep_original=True, subject="subject1")
    dir(data_1)

:abstract: This dataset comprises information regarding the ADLs performed by two users on a daily basis in their
    own homes. This dataset is composed by two instances of data, each one corresponding to a different
    user and summing up to 35 days of fully labelled data. Each instance of the dataset is described by
    three text files, namely: description, sensors events (features), activities of the daily living (labels).
    Sensor events were recorded using a wireless sensor network and data were labelled manually.

The dataset has two datasets. You can load either of the datasets by passing either ``OrdonezA`` or ``OrdonezB`` to
the ``subject`` parameter of the fetch function:

.. code:: python

    from pyadlml.dataset import fetch_uci_adl_binary

    data = fetch_uci_adl_binary(subject='OrdonezA')
    dir(data)
    >>> [..., df_activities, df_devices, ...]

    data = fetch_uci_adl_binary(subject='OrdonezB')
    dir(data)
    >>> [..., df_activities, df_devices, ...]

for my personal take on the dataset take a look at the `uci adl binary subjectA notebook`_ or the `uci adl binary subjectA notebook`_.
