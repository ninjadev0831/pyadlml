Datasets
========

Here is a list of all datasets supported by pyadlml. Make sure to also check out the `notebooks`_.
The *activity_number* and *device_number* are of the following format ``#activities/#recorded activities`` and analog
for the devices.

    subject attribute into the ``fetch_mitlab`` function.

To download the dataset execute

.. code:: python

:organization: Carlos III University of Madrid

:from: $Date: 2013-10-28 19:23:53$
:to: $Date: 2012-01-03 19:23:53$
:activities: 27/2747
:devices: 42/42
:abstract: This dataset comprises information regarding the ADLs performed by two users on a daily basis in their
    own homes. This dataset is composed by two instances of data, each one corresponding to a different
    user and summing up to 35 days of fully labelled data. Each instance of the dataset is described by
    three text files, namely: description, sensors events (features), activities of the daily living (labels).
    Sensor events were recorded using a wireless sensor network and data were labelled manually.

The dataset has two datasets. You can load either of the datasets by passing either ``OrdonezA`` or ``OrdonezB`` to
the ``subject`` parameter of the fetch function:

.. code:: python

    from pyadlml.dataset import fetch_uci_adl_binary

    data = fetch_uci_adl_binary(cache=True, keep_original=True, subject='OrdonezA')
    dir(data)
    >>> [..., df_activities, df_devices, ...]

    data = fetch_uci_adl_binary(cache=True, keep_original=True, subject='OrdonezB')
    dir(data)
    >>> [..., df_activities, df_devices, ...]

for my personal take on the dataset take a look at the `uci adl binary subjectA notebook`_ or the `uci adl binary subjectA notebook`_.
